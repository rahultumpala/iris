# Iris

A tool for visualizing your Elixir codebase.

Iris aims to reduce the time taken to skim through an Elixir codebase by rendering an interactive GUI displaying the constituent applications, modules, methods and method call paths, even documentation!

The following features are implemented.

- List all Applications in elixir lib
- List all Modules in an application
- List all methods in an application
- Generate & View inbound and outbound calls from a selected method
- Click on outbound call method to expand the method and view its outbound calls
- Show Method documentation
- Show Module documentation
- Detect and denote recursive methods with a recursion icon
- Detect and denote methods that have documentation with a docs icon

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `iris` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:iris, "~> 0.1.1"}
  ]
end
```

Hex package located at <https://hexdocs.pm/iris>.

## Usage

Execute the following command after ensuring `iris` is added to your dependency list.

```
mix iris
```

For more info use the verbose flag as such:

```
mix iris -v
mix iris --verbose
```

## Known Limitations

- Functions passed as parameters and invoked using the dot notation are not fully supported
- Lambdas are not fully supported
- All external method calls are not rendered by default, however there should be a toggle for this in the next version of this library
  - External methods refers to Elixir/Erlang modules such as `Keyword`, `Path`, `Enum`, etc.
